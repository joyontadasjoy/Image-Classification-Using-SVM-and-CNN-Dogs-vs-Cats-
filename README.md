    <h1>Cat and Dog Classifier</h1>
    <p>This Jupyter notebook contains a script that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of cats and dogs. The script uses the Keras library to create a CNN model that is trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs, and then evaluated on a separate test set. The trained model can then be used to classify new images of cats and dogs.</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 88% on the test set of images. This indicates that the model is able to distinguish between images of cats and dogs with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
